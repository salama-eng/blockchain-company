    easier, and safer job search. Just as we’ve helped millions of people, let us help you!</p>

 <h1 class="m-4 pt-5 m-auto">How & Why blockchain Started</h1>
<div class="col-12 d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-around align-items-center m-5 align-content-center">
   <img class="col-sm-12 col-lg-4" src="../assets/imges/work.png" alt="">
    <p class="p-5 rounded-1 col-lg-8">blockchain was created in 2007 to provide a trusted, more effective, friendly,
         and overall better way to find professional remote and flexible jobs. We were founded 
         by job space pioneer Sara Sutton after she had been looking for a flexible job after 
         starting her family. She realized that millions of others were just as frustrated by the ads, scams, and inefficiencies on other job boards that wasted her time in finding a good flexible job, and so she decided to create the solution she was looking for. It wasn’t our original intention, but somehow FlexJobs has become a leader in the flexible job movement that's currently disrupting the traditional workforce. And, we seem to show up in the press weekly as people
         turn to us for guidance. You can browse hundreds of those articles on our Press page.</p>
